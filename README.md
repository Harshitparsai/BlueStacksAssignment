BlueStacks Assignment 

Pull this repo and run this project using 
#python main.py 
on command line.

We have a admin user already logged in for this project
username : harshit
password : harshit
role : admin 

there are two roles which a user can have 
normal users called as : user1
admin called as : admin

admin has permission to create a user , delete a user , edit role of the user. normal user can't  do these things he can only login and read.

Admin has all the permission.

Thanks
